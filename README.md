This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations.
The issue arises from providing a string value instead of a number to the `$inc` operator, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors.
The solution shows the correct way to increment a numeric field using the `$inc` operator by passing a numerical value.
